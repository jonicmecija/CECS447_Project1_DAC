# Digital-Analog-Converter

## Overview
This project implements the use of an ARM Microcontroller (TM4C123) and an 8-bit R2R circuit that converts digital signals to be played on an analog speaker. One mode in this project is a "piano key mode" where a sine wave is played at different frequencies that would match notes of a piano. Notes are played through 8 different buttons. Circuit verification is executed through the use of in-lab oscilliscopes to test for saw-tooth, triangle, square, and sine waves at 440Hz each.
